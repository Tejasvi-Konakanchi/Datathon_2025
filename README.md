Welcome to our project submission for the 6th DubsTech Datathon! We are revcraft✨!

## Project Overview

Modecraft (an anonymized real-world company) is an ecommerce store offering a wide range of household items. As part of the datathon, we analyzed their sales data to provide business recomendations from operational and marketing perspectives.

In this project, we focused on answering three main objectives:
- **Identifying seasonal trends** to optimize inventory and marketing planning for each year.
- **Analyzing optimal sales hours** to recommend more profitable store opening times.
- **Priortizing high-potential geographic locations and products** for marketing investment through a custom ProductScore metric.

## Methods and Tools Used
- Data Processing: Python
- Data Visualization: Tableau
- Metric Creation: Custom Formula

## Key Deliverables
- Cleaned Data: Removing duplicates, blank entries, unavilable entries; generated new columns for metrics.
- ProductScore Metric: Developed a formula for ranking products sold
- Final report:
